# emotion-detection-npl

This project aims to predict/detect the emotion given a text.

The dataset is available in this [kaggle link] (https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp
)


The model is built using tensorflow LSTM and some Dense Layer. The details can be found in the notebook (ipynb file) in the same repo.

For deployment I use Docker and Flask.
